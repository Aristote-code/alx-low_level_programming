README.md content for the "0x05-pointers_arrays_strings" directory in your "alx-system_engineering-devops" repository:

# 0x05. Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains my project submissions for the **0x05. Pointers, Arrays, and Strings** module in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps program.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects I have completed for this module:

- 0-reset_to_98
- 1-swap
- 2-strlen
- 3-puts
- 4-print_rev
- 5-rev_string
- 6-puts2
- 7-puts_half
- 8-print_array
- 9-strcpy

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the objective of the project and how to run the code.

## Getting started

To run the code in this directory, you will need a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can compile and execute the code using the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c file.c -o output
./output
```

Make sure to replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile, and `main.c` with the file that contains the `main()` function.
