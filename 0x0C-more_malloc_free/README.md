README.md content for the "0x0C-more_malloc_free" directory in your "alx-system_engineering-devops" repository:

# 0x0C. More Malloc, Free

This directory contains my project submissions for the **0x0C. More Malloc, Free** module in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps program.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects I have completed for this module:

- 0-malloc_checked.c
- 1-string_nconcat.c
- 2-calloc.c
- 3-array_range.c

Each project file contains the implementation of a specific function or task along with a test file to verify its functionality.

## Getting started

To compile and test the code in this directory, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c test_file.c -o output
./output
```

Make sure to replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile and `test_file.c` with the corresponding test file.
