README.md content for the "0x08-recursion" directory in your "alx-system_engineering-devops" repository:

# 0x08. Recursion

This directory contains my project submissions for the **0x08. Recursion** module in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps program.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects I have completed for this module:

- 0-puts_recursion
- 1-print_rev_recursion
- 2-strlen_recursion
- 3-factorial
- 4-pow_recursion
- 5-sqrt_recursion
- 6-is_prime_number
- 7-is_palindrome

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the objective of the project and how to run the code.

## Getting started

To run the code in this directory, you will need a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can compile and execute the code using the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c file.c -o output
./output
```

Make sure to replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile, and `main.c` with the file that contains the `main()` function.

## Description

The **0x08. Recursion** module explores the concept of recursion in programming. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. This module focuses on understanding and implementing recursive solutions to various problem statements.

## Project Overview

- **0-puts_recursion:** This project implements a recursive function to print a string.

- **1-print_rev_recursion:** This project implements a recursive function to print a string in reverse.

- **2-strlen_recursion:** This project implements a recursive function to calculate the length of a string.

- **3-factorial:** This project implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

- **4-pow_recursion:** This project implements a recursive function to calculate the value of a number raised to a power.

- **5-sqrt_recursion:** This project implements a recursive function to calculate the square root of a number.

- **6-is_prime_number:** This project implements a recursive function to check if a number is a prime number.

- **7-is_palindrome:** This project implements a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the code in this directory, ensure that you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) installed on your system. Use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c file.c -o output
./output
```

Replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile, and `main.c` with the file that contains the `main()` function.
