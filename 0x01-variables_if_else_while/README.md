## Description

In this directory, you will find the solutions for the following tasks:

- 0-positive_or_negative.c: Write a C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and determines if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- 1-last_digit.c: Write a C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number along with certain conditions.
- 2-print_alphabet.c: Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 3-print_alphabets.c: Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- 4-print_alphabt.c: Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line.
- 5-print_numbers.c: Write a C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- 6-print_numberz.c: Write a C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only the `putchar` function, followed by a new line.
- 7-print_tebahpla.c: Write a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- 8-print_base16.c: Write a C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 9-print_comb.c: Write a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, followed by a new line.
- 10-print_comb2.c: Write a C program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99, separated by commas, followed by a space.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) version 9.3.0

## Usage

1. Compile the C programs using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file-name>.c -o <output-file-name>
   ```

   Replace `<file-name>.c` with the name of the C file you want to compile, and `<output-file-name>` with the desired name of the output executable file.

2. Run the compiled executable using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./<output-file-name>
   ```

   Replace `<output-file-name>` with the name of the compiled executable file.
