README.md content for the "0x0A. C - argc, argv" directory in your "alx-system_engineering-devops" repository:

# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

This directory contains my project submissions for the **0x0A. C - argc, argv** module in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps program.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects I have completed for this module:

- 0-whatsmyname
- 1-args
- 2-args_rev
- 3-mul
- 4-add

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the objective of the project and how to run the code.

## Getting started

To run the code in this directory, you will need a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can compile and execute the code using the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c file.c -o output
./output arg1 arg2 ...
```

Make sure to replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile, and `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., with the command-line arguments you want to pass to the program.
