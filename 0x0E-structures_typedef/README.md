# 0x0E. Structures, typedef

This directory contains my project submissions for the **0x0E. Structures, typedef** module in the ALX System Engineering & DevOps program.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects I have completed for this module:

- 0-dog.h
- 1-init_dog.c
- 2-print_dog.c
- 4-new_dog.c
- 5-free_dog.c

Each project file contains a specific task or exercise related to structures and typedef in C programming.

## Getting started

To compile and run the code in this directory, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c test_file.c -o output
./output
```

Make sure to replace `file.c` with the specific source code file you want to compile and `test_file.c` with the corresponding test file.
